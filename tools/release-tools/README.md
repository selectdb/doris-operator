# Doris Operator release tools

These scripts package, sign, and publish Apache Doris Operator source releases.
They publish source artifacts only, turn the released Git tag into a GitHub
release, and generate vote and announcement email drafts. They do not create
Git tags or send email.

## Prerequisites

Install `git`, `gpg`, `svn`, `svnmucc`, `sha512sum`, `curl`, `gzip`, and `gh`.
The selected Git tag must already exist locally and on the remote configured by
`GIT_REMOTE`. `gh` must be authenticated for `GITHUB_REPO` (`gh auth login`, or
export `GH_TOKEN`); it is used only by step 4.

Edit `release.env` before each release. In particular, verify:

- `VERSION`, `TAG`, `GIT_REMOTE`, and all derived artifact/SVN paths.
- `APACHE_ID`, `APACHE_EMAIL`, and `SIGNER_NAME`.
- `SIGNING_KEY`: required full fingerprint of a locally available secret key.
- release notes, verification, download, and mailing-list URLs.
- `GITHUB_REPO`, plus `DOCKER_IMAGE` and `DOCKER_IMAGE_URL` for the operator
  image published with this release, for example `apache/doris:operator-26.0.1`.
- `WORK_DIR`, which stores generated artifacts, SVN working copies, and drafts.

`TAG` must be the final version with no RC suffix. Source artifacts and SVN
version directories also use the final version:

```text
apache-doris-operator-26.0.0-src.tar.gz
apache-doris-operator-26.0.0-src.tar.gz.asc
apache-doris-operator-26.0.0-src.tar.gz.sha512
```

SVN credentials are never stored in `release.env` or generated mail files.
Export them in the shell that runs a publishing script:

```bash
export ASF_USERNAME="<apache-id>"
export ASF_PASSWORD="<apache-ldap-password>"
```

Find the full signing-key fingerprint with:

```bash
gpg --list-secret-keys --keyid-format=long --with-fingerprint
```

Copy that fingerprint into `release.env`; `01-check-env.sh` exits immediately
with this guidance when `SIGNING_KEY` is empty.

## Workflow

Run commands from this directory:

```bash
cd tools/release-tools
```

### 1. Check the signing environment

```bash
./01-check-env.sh
```

This requires the signing-key fingerprint configured in `release.env`, checks
the required tools, configures `GPG_TTY`, checks the recommended SHA-512 GPG
preferences, verifies the shared Doris `KEYS` file, and performs a local
sign/verify test. Editing `gpg.conf` and appending a public key to the dev and
release `KEYS` files each require explicit confirmation.

### 2. Package a release candidate when needed

```bash
./02-package-sign-upload.sh
```

This verifies that the local and remote tags resolve to the same commit,
creates a deterministic source archive with `git archive` and `gzip -n`, signs
it, writes a SHA-512 sidecar, and uploads the three source files to:

```text
https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/doris/doris-operator/<version>/
```

If the configured dev SVN directory already exists, skip this step or select a
new version. The script refuses to overwrite an existing version directory and
asks for confirmation both before staging and before commit.

### 3. Generate the vote email

```bash
./03-vote-mail.sh
```

This writes `vote-email.txt` and `vote-email.eml` under `WORK_DIR`.
It prints the subject and body, then leaves sending to the release manager.

Both vote and announcement drafts start with a `Subject:` line followed by a
blank line, so the mail title never has to be retyped.

### 4. Complete a passed release

```bash
./04-release-complete.sh
```

The formal release is created independently from dev SVN. The script re-checks
the local and remote tag, freshly packages the selected Git tag, signs the new
archive, creates a fresh checksum, and uploads those newly generated source
files to:

```text
https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/release/doris/doris-operator/<version>/
```

It does not inspect, compare, promote, move, or delete anything under dev SVN.
It refuses to overwrite an existing release directory and requires two
confirmations.

Once the release files are in release SVN, the script turns the existing Git
tag into a GitHub release on `GITHUB_REPO`. The notes are written to
`github-release-notes.md` under `WORK_DIR`, printed for review, and published
with `gh` after one more confirmation. They link the release-note issue
(`RELEASE_NOTES_URL`), the operator image (`DOCKER_IMAGE`, for example
`apache/doris:operator-26.0.1`, with its `docker pull` command and
`DOCKER_IMAGE_URL`), and the formal source artifacts. `gh release create` runs
with `--verify-tag`, so it publishes the existing tag and never creates one.

Finally the script writes `announce-email.txt` and `announce-email.eml`.

The whole run is idempotent, so an interrupted release can simply be repeated:

- release files already present in release SVN are detected by name, and
  packaging, signing, and the SVN commit are skipped;
- a release directory holding only some of the three files is reported as
  incomplete and stops the run for manual repair;
- an existing GitHub release whose notes already match is left untouched, and
  differing notes are replaced only after an explicit confirmation.

To publish or refresh only the GitHub release:

```bash
./04-release-complete.sh --github-only
```

To regenerate only the announcement drafts:

```bash
./04-release-complete.sh --mail-only
```

`--github-only` skips packaging, GPG, checksums, SVN, and the mail drafts.
`--mail-only` skips Git, packaging, GPG, checksums, SVN, and GitHub.

## Safety boundaries

- No script creates, updates, or pushes a Git tag; the GitHub release is
  published from the existing tag with `gh release create --verify-tag`.
- Local and remote tags are compared by peeled commit ID.
- Generated signatures and checksums are verified immediately.
- Dev and release uploads stop before checkout if the version directory exists.
- SVN target URLs and staged files are shown before both confirmations.
- SVN uploads contain only the source archive, signature, and checksum.
- Existing GitHub release notes are replaced only after a confirmation.
- Public emails are drafts only.
- No email was sent by any script; the release manager sends drafts manually.
- Formal release packaging is independent from dev SVN.

## Tests

The suite uses temporary Git repositories and fake GPG/SVN commands. It does
not modify a real keyring, remote Git repository, SVN repository, or mail
system.

```bash
./tests/run.sh
```
